# COVID-Model

My main objective with this project was to help my community understand how important social distancing is to limit the spread of COVID-19 Pandemic. I used the variable contact ratio to quantify how important social distancing is. During the quarter I made this project, I was taking a Differential Equations course and a Multivariable Calculus course. I turned my set of ordinary differential equations into a set of partial differential equations which depended on time and space. The model was a spinoff from the basic SIR pandemic model with space variable added. Now, with this added variable, pandemic could be viewed as spreading as a wave accross the population. The reason I decided to add space variable is because I feel like space is the most important variable deciding the spread of a pandemic like COVID-19 that is highly contagious. The project was recognized as the best project of the course.
